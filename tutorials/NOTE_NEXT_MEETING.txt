* use of Github,
* make a common database,
* view should be close to the database? or in analysis folder?
* nomenclature:
	- view73 instead of JAPR_language_73
	- T1 instead of tmpT1
	- keep the main comments (you don't know which sql files the new user will be openning first
	- organise the header comment in a pretty way

* nomenclature for views is important so that our python code can recreate the database if there is a problem. Please use:
'my_view_name.sql' for the view 'my_view_name'

* furthermore: if a view is using another view, the name of the used view should come first when ordered by alphanumeric:
> view100 can not be used in view12

* the file: 
29-004 COMPLETE.xls
can not be open with usual/open source excel libraries in python.
It is seen as an encryted file.

* the file:
test_luke/21-14-002.xls
states that the JA Body is unavailable, is it true? (it seems filled)
> I can make a list of suspicious "unavailability" while my program goes through them if you want.
