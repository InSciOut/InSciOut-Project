## Introduction

We made 3 tables in the database JA_table, PR_table and News_table.
We can optimize their creation, create SQLite database is easy with pandas.

Now, for each analyses, it seems that we want to create a `View`.
A `View` is a virtual table defined by a query and can be used an usual table. A `View` is stored in the database once created and can be accessed all the time. Note that a `View` does not use much memory, as it only store the query that defined it.
As a `View`is nothing else as a query, it will update when the other tables/views get updated.
